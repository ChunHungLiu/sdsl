The library can be installed automatically by
running the command
./install.sh YOUR_SDSL_INSTALL_PREFIX

This will download all dependencies (libdivsuftsort
and gtest), build them and install the include
files in ${HOME}/include and the libraries
in ${HOME}/lib. 
After running the script you can change into
the test directory and make and execute the tests by
make && make test

You can compile your own program example.cc by

g++ -O3 -DNDEBUG -funroll-loops -I YOUR_SDSL_INSTALL_PREFIX/include \
    -LYOUR_SDSL_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib -o example example.cc \
	-lsdsl -ldivsufsort -ldivsufsort64
